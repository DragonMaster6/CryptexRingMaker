# Cryptex Ring Maker App
This will be updated later to describe the project in-depth. For now, this app's purpose is to aid in the design of a part found on a Cryptex puzzle box. It creates a JSON array to be imported later into an OpenSCAD file that renders the array into a flattened dough-nut shape.
